## (2) Selected Dataset  
**Dataset**: [LinkedIn Job Postings](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshkon/linkedin-job-postings/data)  

---

## (3) Brief Explanation of the Dataset  

### (a) What the dataset is about  
This dataset contains a nearly comprehensive record of **124,000+ job postings listed in 2023 and 2024**. Each posting includes valuable attributes such as the job title, description, salary, location, application URL, and work-type (remote, contract, etc.). Separate files contain details on **benefits, skills, and industries** associated with postings. The majority of jobs are linked to company data, which include descriptions, headquarters location, employee size, and follower counts.

### (b) Why we find it interesting or relevant  

#### 1. Rich & Multi-Dimensional Data  
This dataset doesn’t just provide job postings but also includes benefits, skills, industries, and company details. The dataset can be used to build **multi-layered visualizations** that connect jobs, companies, and skills together.  

#### 2. Trend Analysis  
Because the data spans 2023 and 2024, we can explore **time-based changes** like hiring surges, seasonal variations, and remote job growth.  

#### 3. Geographic Visualizations  
The detailed location data (city, state, country, zip) allows us to **map job concentrations**. We also plan to explore how **remote jobs** can be displayed geographically.  

#### 4. Salary, Company & Skills — Combined Visualization Potential  
- **Salary & Compensation**: Fields for min, median, and max salaries enable comparison across roles, companies, and regions.  
- **Company-Level Analysis**: Company size and follower counts let us see how hiring differs between startups and enterprises.  
- **Skills & Benefits**: Separate skill/benefit files highlight what companies value most, opening doors for word clouds, bar charts, or network graphs.  

Together, these create rich opportunities for **comparative, interactive, and exploratory dashboards**.  

#### 5. Broad Audience Appeal  
In the era of AI, the job market is disrupted and finding the right job has become increasingly difficult. This analysis will be helpful for students and professionals to understand hiring trends, skills in demand, and opportunities that align with their career goals. Jobs and salaries are universally relatable, making the visualizations naturally engaging.

### (c) Anticipated Challenge  
One challenge we anticipate is the **size and complexity of the dataset** (124,000+ records across multiple files). Cleaning, integrating, and handling different attribute types (numeric, categorical, text, geographic) will require careful preprocessing.  

Another challenge is dealing with unstructured text data such as job descriptions and skill requirements. Extracting meaningful insights will require text preprocessing, natural language processing (NLP), and careful visualization design to avoid oversimplifying complex information.

We confirm that our **group and dataset selection are recorded in the shared spreadsheet.**

## Dataset Selection Process

For this assignment, our group explored multiple platforms and strategies to identify a dataset that was both relevant to real-world issues and suitable for analysis. We began our search by visiting several open data portals. Richa focused on government-based repositories such as the Chicago Open Data Portal and NYC Open Data, which provide a variety of well-documented and publicly accessible datasets. In parallel, Sunil searched Kaggle, a platform known for hosting a diverse collection of community-contributed datasets across domains such as healthcare, finance, and social sciences. Our strategy throughout was to evaluate datasets based on three key factors: real-world applicability, sufficient size for meaningful analysis, and novelty to avoid repeating overly common topics.

While reviewing possible options, we initially considered a COVID-19 dataset because of its strong connection to public health and ongoing relevance. However, we ultimately decided against it since COVID-related datasets have been heavily analyzed in recent years, which could make our project less distinctive. Another dataset that we explored involved job application portal data. This dataset was interesting for studying employment trends, but it was relatively small in size and lacked enough detail to support in-depth analysis. Given these limitations, we set it aside in favor of a dataset that better matched our goals.

The process of narrowing down our options was highly collaborative. We divided the initial search responsibilities, with each member exploring different sources, and then came together to compare findings. Group discussions allowed us to weigh the strengths and weaknesses of each candidate dataset and ensured that everyone’s perspective was considered in the final decision. This collective effort helped us reach a consensus efficiently while ensuring the dataset we selected aligned with our criteria and project objectives.
