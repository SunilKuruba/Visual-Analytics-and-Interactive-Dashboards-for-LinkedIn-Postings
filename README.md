# Visual Analytics and Interactive Dashboards for LinkedIn Postings

This project was completed as part of the academic CS 424 (Data Visualization and Visual Analytics) course and analyzes the LinkedIn Job Postings (2023–2024) dataset (124,000+ postings) to understand how hiring demand, skill requirements, compensation, and remote work vary across time, industries, and U.S. geography. We built a reproducible data-cleaning pipeline, designed domain questions and visualization sketches, and implemented interactive Altair/Vega-Lite dashboards with linked views (skill–salary–geography and industry–salary–skill alignment) plus exploratory charts for seasonality, salary distributions, and remote-work patterns. Finally, we engineered interpretable job embeddings and projected them into 2D (PCA/t-SNE/UMAP comparisons) to power a hosted visual interface for similarity-based exploration of job clusters and outliers.

## Dataset Selection and Motivation

We selected the **LinkedIn Job Postings (2023–2024)** dataset because it provides a large-scale, multi-table view of the job market with **124,000+ postings** plus linked **company, industry, skills, salary, and benefits** data. This structure supports richer analysis than a flat job feed, enabling dashboards that connect **where jobs are**, **what they pay**, and **what skills they require** across time. We chose it through a collaborative search across open-data portals and Kaggle, filtering candidates by real-world relevance, sufficient scale, and novelty, and we anticipate the main challenges will be **data integration across files** and extracting signal from **unstructured text fields** like descriptions and skill requirements.

## Domain Questions, Abstractions, and Sketching

In this assignment, we translated the dataset into six concrete domain questions spanning **time trends, industry volume, skill demand and co-occurrence, salary variation by geography and company attributes, remote-work diffusion, salary transparency, and experience-level pay premiums**. For each question, we defined task abstractions (trend, ranking, correlation, composition, relationship discovery) and produced multiple visualization sketches (lines, bars, heatmaps, boxplots, choropleths, bubble proxy maps, and networks), iterating on designs by balancing clarity vs. expressiveness. The outcome is a coherent analysis plan and visual design rationale that explains what each chart reveals, what tradeoffs exist (e.g., clutter vs. detail), and why specific encodings were chosen to best answer each question.

## Interactive Dashboards and Reproducibility

This assignment delivers **reproducible, interactive Altair dashboards** that operationalize our questions into linked views. The repo includes all required raw and preprocessed CSVs plus notebooks that can be run end-to-end (Altair SVG rendering enabled for GitHub viewing, with optional interactive mode locally). We built two multi-view systems: (1) a **Skill–Salary–Geography** dashboard linking top-skill demand, salary distributions, and state-level skill dominance; and (2) an **Industry–Salary–Skill Alignment** dashboard linking a median-salary choropleth, top-industry composition, and a skill-vs-industry heatmap. In addition, we implemented Richa’s interaction-heavy views: **brush selection** for salary vs. engagement with work-type drilldowns, a **click-selected salary heatmap** with distribution detail, and a **state-level salary choropleth** with tooltips and regional insights, emphasizing performance-aware sampling and stacked `.transform_filter()` coordination for smooth cross-filtering.

## Exploratory Analysis and Interactive Visualizations

This assignment extends our LinkedIn Job Postings work into a structured exploratory pipeline: we documented the dataset schema, built a reproducible preprocessing script (profiling missingness/types, normalizing seniority, parsing skills, annualizing salaries across pay periods, extracting states and mapping to FIPS, de-duplicating), and produced a set of seven Altair/Vega-Lite visualizations that answer core market questions. The deliverables include monthly hiring seasonality (line trend), skill intensity growth by seniority across industries (multi-line), top in-demand skills (static ranking plus an enhanced interactive version), and a geographic salary choropleth (static plus an enhanced interactive map with toggles/filters). We also added richer exploratory views to study remote-work diffusion (proxy bubble distribution), state-by-experience concentration (heatmap), and salary progression with seniority (box plot), finishing with concise learning and insight summaries that connect the visuals back to hiring cycles, skill demand, regional pay disparities, and remote job availability.

## Job Similarity Embeddings and Web-Based Exploration

This assignment converts job postings into **interpretable embeddings** for similarity search and interactive browsing, then projects them into 2D for a hosted visualization site. We engineered feature sets capturing job similarity from multiple angles: skills (top-50 multi-hot), compensation (scaled/log salary), seniority (ordinal or one-hot), work arrangement and remote status, industry and ownership categories, geography (state one-hot or region one-hot), company size buckets, posting recency, and lightweight job-family/title keyword flags. We compared dimensionality reduction methods (PCA vs t-SNE vs UMAP), documented why early iterations failed (outlier-dominated numeric scales, sparse 50-state encoding, weak semantic signal), and iterated toward a final embedding that yields coherent clusters and meaningful brush-based exploration; PCA provided stable global structure, while UMAP was selected for the main interface due to better neighborhood fidelity, outlier visibility, and smoother transitions. The result is a reproducible embedding pipeline plus a GitHub Pages deployment that lets users visually explore clusters such as “remote senior roles,” “high-salary niches,” or “analyst vs engineer families,” and interpret why postings are near each other based on explicit engineered signals rather than black-box text embeddings.
